# Focused Linux

Simple scripts to block distracting social media sites to increase your productivity on Linux

## Download and Installation

Installation is pretty simple. First clone this repo using the command below in your Linux terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iamsubingyawali/focused-linux.git
```
Now navigate to the downloaded directory using **cd** command and run the block script

```sh
cd focused-linux
sudo ./block.sh
```
Follow the instructions and setup your blocking.

Somtimes running the script alone is not sufficient to block sites as most of the browsers have caches. If script doesn't work, try clearing browser caches.

## Modification

If you want to modify your blocked sites, just re-run the block.sh script and follow the instructions.

## Uninstall

To uninstall this program or unblock your sites, just run the unblock.sh script.

```sh
sudo ./unblock.sh
```

_Note_: Only for Linux
